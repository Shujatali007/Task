# Task
Case Study: DataOps and Analytics 
This repository contains two main files: `Data Clean & EDA` and `dashboard.py`. 

- `Data Clean & EDA`: This file focuses on the data cleaning process and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Historical Electricity data. The goal is to preprocess the data and gain insights by analyzing patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset.

- `dashboard.py`: This file utilizes the Python-based visualization framework Plotly Dash to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides visual representations of the Historical Electricity data, allowing users to explore and interact with the data in a user-friendly manner.

## Usage
To use the `dashboard.py` file, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line.
2. Open the `dashboard.py` file in a text editor or IDE.
3. Make sure to update the file path in the script to point to the desired dataset you want to visualize in the dashboard.
4. Save the changes.
5. Run the script using the command `python dashboard.py` in your command line.
6. Access the dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided local server address.
7. Interact with the visualizations and explore the Historical Electricity data through the dashboard interface.

Note: Remember to replace the file path in the `dashboard.py` script with the actual path to your dataset to ensure proper data loading.
